# Console-Based To-Do List Application

[cite_start]This project is a simple yet powerful console-based to-do list application created as part of the **Elevate Labs Python Developer Internship**. [cite: 1, 2] [cite_start]The application is built with Python and is designed to run in a terminal or VS Code. [cite: 5]

## [cite_start]**Objective** [cite: 4]

The primary goal of this task is to implement a straightforward to-do list manager that allows users to perform the following actions:
- [cite_start]**View** all tasks in the list [cite: 9]
- [cite_start]**Add** a new task to the list [cite: 9]
- [cite_start]**Remove** an existing task from the list [cite: 9]

[cite_start]The application ensures that the to-do list is **persistent**, meaning the tasks are saved even after the application is closed.

## [cite_start]**Key Features & Concepts** [cite: 23]

- [cite_start]**File Handling**: Tasks are saved to and loaded from a `tasks.txt` file, demonstrating proficiency in file I/O operations. [cite: 23]
- [cite_start]**Lists**: The core of the application relies on Python lists to manage tasks in memory. [cite: 8, 23]
- [cite_start]**String Manipulation**: The `.strip()` method is used to clean up task entries read from the file. [cite: 15, 23]
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features a clean, color-coded interface for a better user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented to manage invalid user inputs gracefully.

## **How to Run the Application**

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  [cite_start]**Download**: Clone this repository or download the `todo.py` file. [cite: 6]
3.  **Execute**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `todo.py`, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python todo.py
    ```
4.  **Interact**: Follow the on-screen menu to manage your to-do list.
